# headcraftAI Product Specification

## Vision

headcraftAI aims to provide an accessible platform for individuals to generate professional-quality headshots without a photographer. Using advanced AI models from OpenAI (GPT-4 and DALL-E), the app creates realistic headshots based on user-uploaded images, democratizing access to high-quality imagery.

## Target Audience

- Professionals needing headshots for LinkedIn, resumes, or personal branding.
- Students and job seekers looking for affordable profile pictures.
- Anyone seeking a high-quality headshot without professional photography services.

## Key Features

- User authentication and account management via Stack Auth
- Upload functionality for multiple images
- Optional chat interface to refine headshot preferences
- AI-powered headshot generation using OpenAI's GPT-4 and DALL-E
- Secure storage and retrieval of images
- Payment processing for headshot generation via Stripe
- Downloadable headshot images

## User Stories

1. As a user, I want to create an account and log in securely using Stack Auth.
2. As a user, I want to upload multiple images of myself to the app.
3. As a user, I want to optionally specify preferences for my headshot through a chat interface.
4. As a user, I want to initiate the headshot generation process.
5. As a user, I want to view and download my generated headshot.
6. As a user, I want to manage my account and view my past headshots.

## Design Considerations

- **Simple UI**: Intuitive and easy-to-navigate interface.
- **Responsive**: Optimized for both mobile and desktop devices.
- **Feedback**: Clear indicators during image upload and processing.
- **Security**: Safe handling of user data and images.

## Technical Requirements

- Built with **Next.js** and **TypeScript**
- Uses **Neon** for PostgreSQL database
- Uses **Stack Auth** for authentication and user management
- Integrates **OpenAI API** (GPT-4 for analysis, DALL-E for generation)
- Implements **Stripe** for payment processing
- Deployed on **Vercel**

## AI Workflow

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads multiple images to the server
2. **Optional Chat Interaction**: User chats with ChatGPT to specify preferences (e.g., background color, attire)
3. **Prompt Generation**:
   - GPT-4 analyzes uploaded images to create a base description (e.g., "A person with short black hair")
   - Chat history (if any) refines the description (e.g., "A professional headshot with a blue background")
4. **Image Generation**: The final prompt is sent to DALL-E to generate the headshot
5. **Storage**: The generated image is saved and linked to the user's account

## Roadmap

1. **Set up project structure and dependencies**
2. **Implement user authentication with Stack Auth**
3. **Create image upload functionality**
4. **Integrate OpenAI API for headshot generation**
5. **Set up Stripe for payment processing**
6. **Develop frontend UI components**
7. **Test the end-to-end workflow**
8. **Deploy to Vercel**
